# Filmmaking-Project

I made a stop-motion picture as a side project after being inspired by my Visualizations course. The film is accompanied by an analysis paper.

First, please watch the video. You can open 'Defender of Gotham - Movie Link'. Copy and paste the link in a new browser, and it will take you to YouTube. Make sure that the quality is set to 1080p and sound is maxed out for the best viewing experience, and you are watching it on a laptop.

After watching the film, you can review the analysis paper, 'Defender of Gotham - An Analysis.pdf', to get a deeper understanding of the film and the filmmaking process.

Feel free to reach out to me to discuss further.
