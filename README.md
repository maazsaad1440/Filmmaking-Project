# Filmmaking-Project

I made a stop-motion picture as a side project after being inspired by my Visualizations course. The film is accompanied by an analysis paper.

First, please watch the video. You can open 'Defender of Gotham - Movie Link'. Copy and paste the link in a new browser, and it will take you to YouTube. Make sure that the quality is set to 1080p for the best viewing experience, and you are watching it on a laptop.

After watching the film, you can review the analysis paper, 'Defender of Gotham - An Analysis.pdf', to get a deeper understanding of the film and the filmmaking process.

This project was completed on 6th January 2023, one day before he left. He watched the film but didn't hang around long enough to read the paper.

He was the reason I fell in love with films, and I am glad I got to show him a creation of mine before he left us.
